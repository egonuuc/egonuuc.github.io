<div id="text"><h1>About Me</h1><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, my name is Uche Egonu and I am a student at Tufts University. <br>I am a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Political Science. I am <br>from Santa Clara, CA. Academically, I am interested in how data science<br> can be used to help track and analyze political influence. Personally, I am <br>highly involved in dance programs on campus. I am a part of Tufts African Dance Collective and Tufts Jumboraas, a competitive group focusing on Gujarati <br>dance styles, Raas and Garba. I am also an active member of the committee that plans Tufts' Relay for Life. Feel free to contact me!</p></div>
