<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Uche Egonu and I am a student at Tufts University. I am a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Political Science. I am from Santa Clara, CA. Academically, I am interested in how data science can be used to help track and analyze political influence. Personally, I am highly involved in dance programs on campus. I am a part of Tufts African Dance Collective and Tufts Jumboraas, a competitive group focusing on Gujarati dance styles, Raas and Garba. I am also an active member of the committee that plans Tufts' Relay for Life. Feel free to contact me!</p>
