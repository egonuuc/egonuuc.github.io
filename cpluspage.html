		        	<p><span>Tools/Languages Used:</span> C++<br><br>For this homework assignment, I implemented a program that was similar to the Spotlight feature on Macs or the grep command line tool on linux systems. I had to choose a data structure to hold the all the files in a directory that was passed in to my program via the command line. That structure needed to be optimal for searching through and finding keywords that a user could use to search. I needed to search throught he given directory and return all the instances of the keyword that I saw. I chose to use a hash table to implement this program because of the optimal constant time complexity of O1. This allowed me to quickly build a table with all the files and thir lines and then quickly search that table for they keywords. </p>

		        	<p><span>Tools/Languages Used:</span> C++<br><br>For this assignment, I implemented a Reverse Polish Notation Calculator similar to the one seen on the Linux system. The assignment called for us to implement a stack class for the calculator and we had our choice of how we would implement the stack. I chose to use a resizable array because it was more manageable for me to keep track of end positions instead of pointers. This project helped me understand more about abstract data types like stacks along with gurther practice with object-oriented programming.</p>

		        	<p><span>Tools/Languages Used:</span> C++<br><br> With this homework, I implemented a variety of sorts and wrote about their time complexities. I chose to implement an insertion sort, a quick sort, and a shell sort. The sorts were tested with various types of data in order to ensure the functionality of my sort programs. This homework helped me learn more about time complexity as I had to also explain my estimates for which sort would be the fastest and which sorts could have corresponded to certain times for sorrting lists. I also had to explain the best, worst, and average cases for each sort. </p>

		        	<p><span>Tools/Languages Used:</span> C<br><br> For this homework, I worked with a partner to implement an unboxed, polymorphic 2 dimensional array and use it in various ways. For the first part, we created an the interface for our abstract data type, along with the implementation. Then, we used that idea to creare a 2 dimensional bit vector abstraction. We used the unboxed array interface to create a sudoku board validator. For the 2d bit vector, we used that to create a program that took out black edges in pictures and scanned images/files. In order to make this work, my partner and I implemented a breadth-first search using a stack so that we could go through the image and search for black edge pixels without risking a stack overflow with recursion.</p>
