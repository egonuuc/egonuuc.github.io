		        	<p><span>Tools/Languages Used:</span> Python (PyGame)<br><br>For Girls Who Code, we did a variety of Python practice with our students. One of the projects that we gave them was to create a side scroller game using the PyGame module. In order to teach it to them, I created a side scroller game of my own. This assignment gave me practice with object-oriented programming in the Python language. In addition, I helped many of the students with probles with their games, thus further practicing my debugging skills with Python. </p>

As done before, I created a sample project to show the girls how a finished product should look like. This assignment also used object-oriented programming skills and gave me further pracice with the Python language. This was also the first class in which we introduced object-oriented programming to the girls. Thus, I was able to work on teaching the students concepts like classes, inheritance, and objects.</p>

In addition, when I was prepping for teaching the curriculum, this assignment was my first introduction to using Python. We used the PIL (pillow) library and worked on extracting and manipulating pixel data in pictures in order to create an "obamicon" filter for any photo passed in. </p>

		        	<p><span>Tools/Languages Used:</span> Python<br><br> With this assignment, we taught the girls a little about algorithms. We first taught them about different sorts and what the different complexities could be for those sorts. We then worked with them to understand the algorithm behind binary searches. As usual, we created an assignment for them to practice this concept and we made a sample that could help them with understanding the functionality of the finished product. For this assignment, I created a list of people and implemented a simple insertion sort to alphabetize the data. Then I implemented a binary search to find certain people.  </p>
