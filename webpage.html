For this site, I had to think a lot about which type of layout would be easiest to navigate yet still have aesthetic appeal. I chose to utilize the Bootstrap framework so that my site would be responsive and thus seen well on smaller devices as well as computers. </p>

It was a group project in which we used tried to use different tools to create a game. In our case, we decided to make a tweet generator that functioned like the game mad-libs. Users would input three words and it would re-populate an already existing Donald Trump tweet with their words. For this project, we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end. Additionally, I created a background image for one of the pages on Photoshop. For creating the tweets, we stored Donald Trump's tweets in a database using MongoDB. We also used the Merriam-Webster Dictionary api to determine the parts of speech of the user input. Finally, we used Git extensively to share work as a team for this project. </p>

It was broken into two parts: the front-end aspect and the back-end aspect. For the front-end, we learned how to use JavaScript by creating the interface for a hypothetical ride-sharing app. I learned how to use functions from the Google Maps API and wrote JavaScript functions to display a map of my location and calculate distance from different points. In addition to this, we implemented the back-end for the app suing MongoDb. In this, I created a database of both passengers and drivers and created functions to show which drivers were close by to a passenger at a certain point. I also learned how to deploy apps to Heroku sing this process. </p>

I helped teach programming fundamentals t0 20 studenets for 7 weeks in a classroom in Microsoft's Silicon Valley campus. IN order to teach the girls about web programming, I created many web sample programs. These included a sample blog using the Django framework, a passowrd security checker program using JavaScript, and a sorting program using JavaScript. </p>
